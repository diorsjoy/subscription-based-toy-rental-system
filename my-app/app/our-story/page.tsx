              Oiyn Shak was born out of a simple idea: what if we could provide
              children with access to a wide variety of toys without
              contributing to clutter and waste?
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4 max-w-2xl">
              Founded in 2020 by two parents, Aisha and Nurlan, who were
              frustrated with the constant cycle of buying toys that were
              quickly outgrown or forgotten, Oiyn Shak started as a small
              community project in Almaty.

            <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl">
              What began as a local toy-sharing initiative among friends quickly
              grew into a full-fledged business as more families recognized the
              value of a toy rental service.

          <h2>Our Growth</h2>
          <p>
            As word spread about Oiyn Shak, we expanded our operations to cover
            major cities across Kazakhstan. We invested in a state-of-the-art
            cleaning and sanitization process to ensure the safety and quality
            of our toys.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022, we launched our digital platform, making it easier for
            families to browse, select, and schedule toy deliveries from the
            comfort of their homes.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Today, Oiyn Shak serves thousands of families across Kazakhstan, but
            our core mission remains the same: to bring joy and learning to
            children while promoting sustainability.
          </p>
          <p>
            We envision a future where toy rental is the norm, not the
            exception. A future where children have access to a diverse range of
            high-quality toys, and parents can provide enriching play
            experiences without the burden of clutter or environmental guilt.
          </p>
          <p>Join us in reimagining the future of play â€“ one toy at a time.</p>
