    question: "How does the toy rental subscription work?",
    answer:
      "Our toy rental subscription allows you to choose toys from our catalog, have them delivered to your home, and return them when you're ready for new ones. You pay a monthly fee based on your chosen plan, which determines how many tokens you receive and how often you can swap toys.",
    icon: RefreshCw,
    category: "Getting Started",
  },
  {
    question: "Are the toys clean and safe?",
    answer:
      "We have a rigorous cleaning and sanitization process for all toys between rentals. Each toy undergoes professional cleaning with child-safe products and UV sanitization. We also regularly inspect toys for any damage or wear to ensure they meet our high safety standards.",
    icon: Shield,
    category: "Safety & Quality",
  },
  {
    question: "What if a toy gets damaged while we have it?",
    answer:
      "We understand that accidents happen, especially with children at play. Our subscriptions include basic damage protection for normal wear and tear. For more extensive damage, we assess each situation individually and may charge a small fee depending on the extent of the damage.",
    icon: CheckCircle,
    category: "Policy",
  },
  {
    question: "How long can we keep the toys?",
    answer:
      "You can keep the toys for as long as you like within your subscription period! There are no strict return deadlines. However, to make the most of your subscription and try more toys, we recommend swapping toys regularly based on your plan's allowance.",
    icon: Clock,
    category: "Usage",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I purchase a toy if my child really loves it?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! If your child falls in love with a particular toy, you have the option to purchase it at a discounted rate (usually 20-30% off retail price). Just let us know through the app or website, and we'll arrange the purchase and remove the toy from your rental queue.",
    icon: Heart,
    category: "Purchase Options",
  },
  {
    question: "How does delivery and pickup work?",
    answer:
      "We offer free delivery and pickup within Almaty, Nur-Sultan, and Shymkent. Delivery typically takes 1-2 business days. You can schedule pickups through our app when you're ready to return toys. For other cities, we provide convenient shipping options.",
    icon: Truck,
    category: "Delivery",
  },
  {
    question: "What age ranges do you cover?",
    answer:
      "Our toy collection covers children from 6 months to 12 years old. Each toy in our catalog clearly indicates the recommended age range, developmental benefits, and safety considerations. You can filter toys by age in our browse section.",
    icon: Star,
    category: "Age & Development",
